			While the APIs around Concurrent Mode and Suspense are still experimental,
			we’re confident that the ideas in this post are proven by practice.
			However, we understand that Relay and GraphQL aren’t the right fit for
			everyone. That’s ok! We’re actively exploring how to generalize these
			patterns to approaches such as REST, and are exploring ideas for a more
			generic (ie non-GraphQL) API for composing a tree of data dependencies. In
			the meantime, we’re excited to see what new libraries will emerge that
			implement the patterns described in this post to make it easier to build
			great, fast user experiences.
